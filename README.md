<h1>Web-Calculator</h1>

<p>Web-Calculator is a vue3 app, with a basic calculator UI.</p>
<p>All the business "logic" is done on the server side, and the communication is done with axios/front to RESTapi/back.</p>
<p>The main technologies used for this end to end project are: Vue3, scss, nodeJS, express, RESTapi.</p>

<p>Will be deployed in the near future (and the link will be updated)</p>

<p>Thank you very much for this very interesting home assignment!
I still need to improve my order algorithm (bonus) to work perfectly on every scenario (works for basic expressions), and have a validation the confirms that the input 
isnt harmful (could be a problem when combining with eval()). Also I need to add the colored response task, will be done soon.

PS: I am going to keep on improving this project with some extra style and more accurate order algorithm, might be later today since I am working, but will do it.
Also, my development repos was deleted by me because I have decided to split my front & back into a different remote repos, so I dont have "smart" commits like I usually have.

Thank you!
Or :)
